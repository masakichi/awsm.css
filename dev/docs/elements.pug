    h2 Lists

    p There's boring unordered list of jedi masters:

    ul
      li Obi-Wan Kenobi
      li Luke Skywalker
      li Yoda

    p Let's rank them!

    ol
      li Luke Skywalker
      li Yoda
      li Obi-Wan Kenobi

    p And we also have description lists:

    dl
      dt Blizzard
      dd A howling blizzard is summoned to strike the opposing team. It may also freeze them solid.

      dt Hidden Power
      dd A unique attack that varies in type depending on the Pokémon using it.

      dt Waterfall
      dd The user charges at the target and may make it flinch. It can also be used to climb a waterfall.

      code p

    p There are many others stylized inline tags in lib, but it would be boring to list them all.
